# Fitness-Activity-Data-Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis of fitness and health activity data using Python and Jupyter.

This project is my first exploratory data analysis (EDA) project and marks the beginning of my work toward an internship in data analytics, data science, or data engineering.

The goal of this project was to practice working with a real-world dataset and building a strong foundation in:
- data cleaning and validation
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- data visualization
- interpreting insights from both charts and statistics

Using fitness activity data from users wearing fitbits, I explored daily step patterns, activity intensity, sedentary behavior, and the relationship between steps and sedentary time. All analysis, visualizations, and interpretations are documented directly in the notebook.

This project is intended as a learning-focused first step, with future projects building on the skills developed here.
